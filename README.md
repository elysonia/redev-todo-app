## Mini-project: Simple Todo App

Based on my Redmi Note 10 Pro default Tasks App that I use frequently. The aim is to emulate the features I like from the Tasks App which shouldn't be too hard as a learning project.

## App Features

- Create tasks with subtasks
- Seamless subtask create/delete/update actions
- Tasks are saved continuously while editing but you can also save manually
- Pick up right where you left even when you forgot to save before exiting
- Set reminders, pick from 5 alarm sounds and get desktop notifications
- Elegant glassmorphism design
- Beautiful background picture (I might add more to choose from)

## Why did I make this

- To learn TypeScript because I need work
- To use libraries I've always wanted to try i.e. Zustand, RHF (useFieldArray)
- To work with real CSS again after years of JSS (no hate, just miss it)
- To maintain good programming form :D

## TODO

1. I got a little lazy with separating components, so the next main thing is to clean them up.
2. Improve performance with virtualization. It is not a big deal when the tasks and subtasks are small in number and the use cases for the app are narrow but I want to try this anyway. I had attempted this for a couple of days but wasn't able to get a good result because of the way I structured nested fields. I decided to just implement the features I want as fast I can and then another look at it.
3. Make the theme customizable. I want color sliders.
