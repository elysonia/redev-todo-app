## Mini-project: [Taskeep](https://redev-taskeep.vercel.app/)

A simple todo app based on my Redmi Note 10 Pro default Tasks App that I use frequently. The aim is to emulate the features I like from the Tasks App which shouldn't be too hard as a learning project.

## App Features

- Create tasks with subtasks
- Seamless subtask create/delete/update actions
- Pick up right where you left even when you forgot to save before exiting
- Set reminders, pick from 5 alarm sounds and get desktop notifications
- Elegant glassmorphism design
- Beautiful background picture (I might add more to choose from)
- Local data storage - different browser, different storage.

## Why did I make this

- To get better at TypeScript
- To use libraries I've always wanted to try i.e. Zustand, RHF (useFieldArray)
- To work with real CSS again after years of JSS (no hate, just miss it)
- To maintain good programming form :D

## TODOs

1. Clean up components. I got a little lazy with separating components, so the next main thing is to clean them up.
2. Improve performance. I have some unmemoized components and the list could potentially grow bigger so might be good to implement virtualization.
3. Expand/minimize tasks. Like an accordion.
4. Make the theme customizable. I want color sliders.
